 * This class is used for generating mock data for unit tests. It includes methods for generating random passwords, as well as adding user names, emails, and notes via JSON files. It's currently only used for debugging purposes, but could potentially be spun out into its own repository or framework and launched on a platform like Product Hunt.
 * - Description: MockGen is a utility class used for generating mock data for unit tests. It can generate random passwords and add user names, emails, and notes via JSON files. Currently, it is used for debugging purposes but has the potential to be developed into a standalone repository or framework.
 * - Note: We can use this in other frameworks if we use `@testable import Account`
 * - Fixme: ⚠️️ Add the random password methods from `UITests`. (or move them?)
 * - Fixme: ⚠️️ Consider spinning MockGen out into its own repository or framework. (We can make the account an extension in the account lib etc)
 * - Fixme: ⚠️️ Add support for user names, emails, and notes via JSON files.
